YOU CAN VIEW THESE FILES ONLINE! replace X with the candidate you're interested in: 
https://shdaniels.github.io/rwe_lightcurves/without_images/cand_X_without_images.html

There are 31 total candidates indexed from 0-30. The only diifference between the two folders with_images and without_images is that the full image is displayed in the versions in with_image, which also makes the files much larger and slower to load.
